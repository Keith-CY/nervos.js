# Overview

The `cita-sdk-js` library is a collection of packages which contains specific functionality for the [CITA](https://citahub.com/) ecosystem.

- The `@cryptape/cita-sdk` is for interacting with `CITA` and has been published at [@cryptape/cita-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cryptape/cita-sdk)
- The `@cryptape/cita-signer` is for signing transaction for `CITA` and has been published at [@cryptape/cita-signer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cryptape/cita-signer)

# Version

`@cryptape/cita-sdk` strictly abides by Semver, and is compatible with [CITA](https://github.com/cryptape/cita) by `MAJOR` and `MINOR` version, e.g. `@cryptape/cita-sdk@0.20.x` will work perfectly with `CITA@0.20`
